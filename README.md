Here's a fancy little databased thing I've created while learning on the job.

Created database SQL Server 2012 to understand basic database creation and Stored Procedure use.

Solution created in VS 2012 Ultimate using Empty Web Forms. Connected the database to FormViews, 
GridViews and LinkViews with ASP.NET. Nothing too fancy. Just understanding how everything gets connected.

Watched video on Lynda.com to understand how to load it onto GitHub.
